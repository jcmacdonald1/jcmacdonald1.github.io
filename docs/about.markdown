Hello, welcome to my website. My name is Jack and I'm a postdoctoral researcher in experimental particle physics at the [Johannes Gutenberg-Universit√§t Mainz][johannes], Germany. Currently I am a member of both the [ATLAS][atlas] and [FASER][faser] collaborations at CERN, where I am mainly involved in searches for axion-like particles (ALPs). Previously I've also worked on precision Standard Model (SM) measurements with ATLAS.

Here I mostly write about physics topics that interest me. I am by no means an expert on (m)any of these topics, so please take what you read here with caution.
